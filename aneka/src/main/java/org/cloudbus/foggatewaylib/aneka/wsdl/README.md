Files in this directory were generated from WSDL using 
[wsdl2ksoap2-android](https://code.google.com/archive/p/wsdl2ksoap2-android/)
and later modified due to some issues with the generated files.
The main problem was that inherited classes were empty so I had to fill
them manually (that's a pretty mechanic task so it didn't take much).

Using these classes directly means writing a lot of boilerplate code
so consider using the AnekaWebServices class whenever possible.
